# Adding a custom CSS file to Board Game Arena

The BGA site is pretty old school and sometimes just unclear! This is an attempt to improve it a little using only CSS.

**Please read ALL the instructions below otherwise it will seem like the site is broken!!**

1. [Log in to BGA](https://en.boardgamearena.com/account?redirect=/preferences?section=advanced) using that link
	1. If you weren't taken straight to a page with a textarea input on it...
	1. Click the icon in the top right -> "Preferences" -> "Advanced" tab
1. In another window, open and copy [this custom CSS code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paul-norman/bga-css/master/bga-light.css)
1. Back in the first window paste the entire contents of that file into the text box and press "Save"
1. It would be nice if that was all you had to do, but BGA has a bug with this system. You need to follow this path to actually enable the code:
	1. Scroll down past the mess of CSS code that will now be at the top of the screen
	1. Click on any of the header menu items **ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE** *(e.g. Play Now, News, Games etc.)*
	1. Refresh that page manually **DO NOT SKIP THIS**

After that is complete, the site should look largely similar, but have a slightly cleaner style and display messages and prompts in a manner that they are easier to follow.

Enjoy!
